  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 28, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>This app is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect any personally identifiable information without your knowledge. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data related to app features such as login, history storage, and scanning.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> We use Google Sign-In only to authenticate your identity. We access your basic profile (name, email, profile picture) strictly for login and syncing purposes. No data is shared externally.</li>
    <li><strong>Scan & QR Data:</strong> All QR code and barcode scans are processed locally on your device. We do not send scanned content to any external server.</li>
    <li><strong>History:</strong> Your scan/generation history is saved locally on your device. If you're signed in with Google, it can be synced to your personal Firestore database for backup and recovery. You can delete history anytime.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash Reports & Analytics (optional):</strong> If enabled, anonymous usage and crash data may be collected via Firebase Analytics or Crashlytics to improve app quality. No personal data is included.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use your data only for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Providing core app features (e.g., sign-in, history syncing)</li>
    <li>Improving app stability and performance (if analytics are enabled)</li>
    <li>Syncing your QR history across devices (if you are signed in)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third-party Services</h2>
  <p>We use trusted third-party services which may handle data under their own privacy terms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Google Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Crashlytics)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google AdMob (if ads are shown)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Control</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear all locally stored data from the Settings screen.</li>
    <li>You can revoke Google Sign-In access at any time via your Google Account settings.</li>
    <li>If using Firestore, your data is stored securely and can only be accessed by you via your authenticated Google account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe your child has used the app and provided information, please contact us.</p>
